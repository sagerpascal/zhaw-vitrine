# ZHAW-Vitrinr

This is a very Webapp based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
The webapp is used to explain various objects showcased inside the class cabinet at ZHAW's Center for AI.

## Gesture Recognition

It has an integrated gesture recognition running locally within the browser to switch between pages, allowing to switch pages manually even though the tablet is inside the glas cabinet.
